## üîß Requirements

### Android

This plugin requires several changes to work on Android devices. Please make sure you follow all
these steps:

- Use Android 5.0 (API level 21) and above.
- Use Kotlin version 1.8.0 and above

- Use `FlutterFragmentActivity` instead of `FlutterActivity` in
  `MainActivity.kt`: [Link](https://github.com/Just4prog/easy_stripe_payment/blob/master/example/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/example/MainActivity.kt#L3-L7)

  ```

### iOS

Compatible with apps targeting iOS 13 or above.

To upgrade your iOS deployment target to 13.0, you can either do so in Xcode under your Build
Settings, or by modifying `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` in your `project.pbxproj` directly.

You will also need to update your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
```

For card scanning, add the following to your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Scan your card to add it automatically</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>To scan cards</string>
```

---

## üìå Installation

run:

```sh
flutter pub add easy_stripe_payment
```

```yaml
dependencies:
  easy_stripe_payment: ^4.0.8
```

---

## Test Mode :

```dart
await EasyStripePaymentTest.instance.init(
  secretKey: "sk_test_...",
  publishKey: "pk_test_...",

```

‚ö†Ô∏è Use this only in development ‚Äî Never expose your secretKey in production apps.

---

## üß™ Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Stripe

await EasyStripePayment.instance.initStripe(
  publishKey: "pk_test_...Just4prog.nl...",
  baseUrl: "https://Just4prog.nl/",
  merchantName: "Just4prog.nl",
);
```

---

### 2. Start Payment Flow

final result = await EasyStripePayment.instance.makePayment(
  paymentIntentEndpoint: "create-payment-intent/",
  amount: 99.99,
  currency: "eur",
  name: "Ahmed",
  email: "Ahmed@Just4prog.nl",
  city: "Amsterdam",
  country: "NL",
  postalCode: "1234AB",
);
```

---

### 3. Verify Payment

```dart
final verification = await EasyStripePayment.instance.verifyPayment(
  statusEndpoint: "verify-payment/",
  paymentIntentId: result.getOrElse(() => ""),
);
```

---

### 4. Get Charge Details

```dart
final chargeDetails = await EasyStripePayment.instance.getChargeDetails(
  chargeDetailsEndpoint: "charge-details/",
  chargeId: "ch_1XYZ...",
);
```

---

### 5. Refunds (Full / Partial)

```dart
// Full refund
await EasyStripePayment.instance.refundPayment(
  refundEndpoint: "process-refund/",
  chargeId: "ch_1XYZ...",
);

// Partial refund
await EasyStripePayment.instance.partialRefund(
  partialRefundEndpoint: "partial-refund/",
  amount: 50.00,
  chargeId: "ch_1XYZ...",
);
```

## üß† Architecture Overview

- `EasyStripePayment` is a singleton for global access.
- Integrates with your backend to handle all sensitive operations.
- Uses `Dio` for HTTP requests.
- Uses `Either<Error, Result>` from Dartz to make error handling easy and expressive.
